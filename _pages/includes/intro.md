Hi! I am Mingzhe Li, an NLP researcher and algorithm engineer in ByteDance.

After earning my M.S. from Peking University, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/zhaodongyan/en/">Dongyan Zhao</a>, I joined Ant Group and later ByteDance. At Ant Group, I served as the algorithm owner for search relevance, where I developed attribute-aware multi-intent text matching models and an LLM knowledge-injected semantic matching framework for Alipay. At ByteDance, I now lead intelligent outbound-call platforms, architecting LLM-based dialogue models, TTS engines, and an end-to-end Audio-LLM that serve millions of users.

My research interest includes retrieval for searching, LLM-based dialogue, Multi-Agent Framework, and Audio-LLM. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation or have any questions for me, please feel free to email me at [limingzhe.lmz@bytedance.com](mailto:limingzhe.lmz@bytedance.com).
